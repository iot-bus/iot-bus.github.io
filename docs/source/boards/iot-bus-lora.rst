This IoT-Bus module utilizes the Hope RFM95 to offer low-cost, LoRa radio transmission and a Wi-Fi/LoRa gateway.
The RFM95W transceivers  feature  the  LoRaTM  long range modem that provides ultra-long range spread spectrum communication and high interference immunity whilst minimizing current consumption.

Using Hope RF’s patented LoRaTM modulation technique RFM95W can achieve a sensitivity of over -148dBm using a low cost crystal and bill of materials. The high sensitivity combined with the integrated +20 dBm power amplifier yields  industry  leading  link  budget  making  it optimal for any application requiring range or robustness. LoRaTM also provides significant advantages in both blocking and selectivity over conventional modulation techniques, solving the traditional design compromise between range, interference immunity and energy consumption.
These devices also support high performance (G)FSK modes for systems including WMBus, IEEE802.15.4g. The RFM95W deliver exceptional phase noise, selectivity, receiver linearity  and  IIP3  for  significantly lower  current consumption than competing devices.
