Iot-Bus Examples Index
======================

You can find the examples on the iot-bus `GitHub page <https://github.com/iot-bus>`_. The examples are in two repositories:

`iot-bus-mozilla-iot-examples-platformio <https://github.com/iot-bus/iot-bus-mozilla-iot-examples-platformio>`_
    Examples in c++ format and platformio.ini files that contain library dependencies.

`iot-bus-mozilla-iot-examples-arduino <https://github.com/iot-bus/iot-bus-mozilla-iot-examples-arduino>`_
    Examples in ino format. You will need to separately install library dependencies described in each example.

The examples that are described in this section are a subset of the examples in the repository.
