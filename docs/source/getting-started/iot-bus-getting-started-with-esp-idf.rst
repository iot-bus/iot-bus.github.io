Getting Started with esp-idf
============================

The hard way to `setup esp-idf is here <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/>`_ . It's much easier using platformIO because it does all the hard work behind the scenes.
However it maybe useful to see the steps involved. See Getting Started with Platformio for the easy way to use esp-idf.
